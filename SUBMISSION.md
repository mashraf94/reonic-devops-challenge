# üéØ Reonic DevOps Challenge - Submission

## üèóÔ∏è How I approached the task

**First**, I designed a simple but secure architecture:

- **VPC network** with proper subnet segmentation
- **Private subnets** for Lambda functions
- **Isolated subnets** for database instances
- **Private Link endpoint** to Secrets Manager for secure internal access
- **Lambda functions** in private subnets with restricted security groups
- **RDS PostgreSQL** in isolated subnets, only accessible from Lambda
- **Database credentials** managed through Secrets Manager
- **Edge API Gateway** exposing a REST API backed by the Lambda function

**Second**, I translated this architecture to CDK by creating several stacks:
- **Networking Stack**: VPCs, subnets, security groups, and Private Link endpoints
- **Database Stack**: RDS instances, database subnet groups, and parameter groups
- **Compute Stack**: Lambda functions and API Gateway

**Third**, I setup a GitHub Actions pipeline with two main jobs:

1. **Build and Push Docker Image:**
   - Builds the Node.js application and creates the docker image
   - Creates AWS ECR Repository if it doesn't exist
   - Pushes docker image to ECR Repository with proper tagging

2. **Deploy Infrastructure & Lambda Function:**
   - Compiles the CDK stacks and deploys infrastructure to AWS
   - Handles environment-specific deployments based on branch

## ‚ö° The Challenge: Scaling and Multi-Environment Support

After finishing the initial solution, I realized it had limitations:

- **Scalability Issue**: The CDK repo could only manage a single Lambda function and one database
- **Multi-environment Complexity**: Managing multiple environments created messy resource naming and configuration

## üîß The Solution: Refactoring for Scale

I restructured the entire project using a **stage ‚Üí stack ‚Üí construct** pattern:

![CDK Structure](./cdk.png)

### Reusable Constructs
- **Docker Lambda**: Opinionated construct with API Gateway integration and sensible defaults
- **Postgres Database**: Environment-specific configurations with proper subnet groups and security
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive CloudWatch alarms for Lambda, API Gateway, and RDS with SNS notifications

### Scalable Stack Architecture
- **Compute Stack**: Can now create multiple lambda functions with just a few lines of code
- **Database Stack**: Easy to spin up multiple postgres databases with consistent configurations
- **Network Stack**: Centralized VPC, subnet, and security group management

### Environment Management
- **CDK Stages**: Used AWS CDK Stage construct to create completely isolated dev and prod environments
- **Configuration-driven**: Simple config file to differentiate between dev and prod environments
- **Branch-based deployment**: Dev branch ‚Üí dev environment, main branch ‚Üí prod environment
- **Complete separation**: Each stage deploys its own set of stacks, environments are fully isolated

### Monitoring and Deployment Strategy
- **Comprehensive monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms for Lambda errors/duration, API Gateway 4XX/5XX errors/latency, and RDS CPU/storage metrics
- **Alert notifications**: SNS email subscriptions for all critical system health alerts
- **Safe production deployments**: CodeDeploy canary deployments roll out changes to 10% of traffic over 5 minutes with automatic rollback on alarm triggers

## üìù Assumptions and Trade-offs

### Assumptions

- **Regional Strategy**: Assumed as Reonic is a German Company, we'd want to host production in Frankfurt to comply with German data regulation and protection laws
  - Even though it's not the most cost-efficient region, compliance was prioritized
  - However, dev environment is hosted in N. Virginia since it's the most cost efficient for development work

- **Database Secret Format**: Had to assume the database secret parser in the original code had a misspelling
  - The code referenced `secret.database` but RDS auto-generated secrets use `secret.dbname`
  - Updated the handler code to support both formats for flexibility

- **No Internet Connectivity Required**: Determined that Lambda functions don't need internet access, so I removed NAT Gateways to reduce costs
  - Database connections are internal VPC traffic
  - Secrets Manager access goes through VPC Endpoint (PrivateLink)
  - In case a Lambda Function, requires internet access, NAT Gateways is set at the config level to be enabled

- **Database Isolation**: Assumed every database instance would be isolated with no inter-database connections
  - Each database gets its own subnet group and parameter group for complete isolation
  - Simpler security model with clear boundaries

- **Lambda-to-API Gateway Mapping**: Assumed each Lambda function would have its own dedicated API Gateway
  - One-to-one mapping provides clear ownership and isolated routing
  - Simpler to manage permissions and monitoring per function

### Trade-offs

- **SSL Connection**: Turned off SSL for postgres v15 instead of setting up SSL connection between Lambda and RDS
  - This avoided heavy changes to database connection setup in lambda function in case it was out of scope
  - Recognized this as a security trade-off for development speed
- **Authentication Method**: Used GitHub Actions secrets with Access Keys as instructed by the task
  - Instead of setting up more secure OIDC connection between GitHub and AWS
  - Simpler approach but less secure than best practices would suggest
- **Connection Management**: Avoided using RDS Proxy for better connection pooling and management with IAM Authentication
  - Would require significant code changes and couldn't use the existing secret string with DB connection info
  - Decided to keep the simpler direct connection approach for this implementation

## üöÄ How to use the solution and test it

### Setup Requirements

1. **Repository Setup:**
   - Fork the repo to your GitHub account
   - Create a branch called 'dev' from main
   - Enable GitHub Actions on your forked repo

2. **GitHub Repository Configuration:**

   **Required Secrets** (AWS permissions needed: CloudFormation, VPCs, EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, ECR, RDS, Secret Manager, SNS, CodeDeploy):
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

   **Required Variables:**
   - `DEV_AWS_REGION` (e.g., us-east-1)
   - `PROD_AWS_REGION` (e.g., eu-central-1)

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Edit `config/environment-config.ts` with your preferences for dev and prod
   - **Important**: Update the `alertEmail` field with your email address for monitoring notifications:
     ```typescript
     monitoring: {
       alertEmail: "your-email@example.com",
     }
     ```
   - Adjust instance classes, storage sizes, and other settings as needed

### Deployment Process

1. Make your changes to application or infrastructure code
2. Push to `dev` branch ‚Üí deploys to development environment
3. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys your app and infrastructure
4. Once satisfied with dev, merge to `main` branch ‚Üí triggers production deployment

### Testing the Deployed Solution

1. **Get API Endpoint**:
   - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí CloudFormation ‚Üí Your stack ‚Üí Outputs tab
   - Copy the API Gateway endpoint URL (something like `https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/`)

2. **Test the Lambda Function**:
   ```bash
   # Test the API endpoint
   curl https://your-api-endpoint.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/dev/

   # Expected response (JSON):
   {
     "message": "Successfully inserted record and retrieved count",
     "insertedId": 1,
     "totalRecords": 1,
     "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
   }
   ```

3. **Verify Database Functionality**:
   - Run the curl command multiple times
   - Watch the `totalRecords` count increase with each request
   - This confirms Lambda is successfully connecting to RDS and inserting data

4. **Monitor System Health**:
   - **CloudWatch Logs**: Go to CloudWatch ‚Üí Log Groups ‚Üí `/aws/lambda/your-function-name` to see execution logs
   - **CloudWatch Metrics**: Check Lambda, API Gateway, and RDS metrics in CloudWatch
   - **Email Alerts**: You should receive SNS email notifications if any alarms trigger
   - **RDS Activity**: Verify database connections in RDS console performance insights

### Operational Improvements
- Add integration tests in the CI/CD pipeline to test deployed API endpoints
- Setup centralized logging and structured log aggregation for better debugging
- Add cost monitoring and budget alerts to track AWS spend across environments
- Implement automated database schema migrations

### Architecture Flexibility
- Make constructs more flexible to allow resource sharing when appropriate
- Allow multiple databases to share parameter groups and subnet groups
- Enable Lambda functions to share API Gateways with route-based configuration for better resource utilization and complex solutions
